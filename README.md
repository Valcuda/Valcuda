Hello! I'm Valcuda!

I have a dozen hobbies, and one of them is programming in Godot, be warned though, _I'm not very good at it._ Still, it's enough to get the job done most of the time.
I mainly just write basic tools to help with stories I'm working on. Feel free to use any you find useful, or even contribute to make them better if you can!
